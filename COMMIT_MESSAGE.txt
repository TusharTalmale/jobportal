# Fix: Jobs and Companies Not Displaying in UI

## Summary
Fixed critical bug preventing jobs and companies from displaying in Flutter UI despite successful backend data fetch.

## Changes Made

### 🔴 CRITICAL BUG FIX
**File**: `lib/provider/job_provider.dart`

**Issue**: `_activeFilters.clear()` was called inside `.where()` loop during filtering, corrupting filter state on every job iteration.

**Fix**: Moved filter clear and setup outside the loop to execute once before filtering starts.

**Impact**: 
- ✅ Filters now work correctly
- ✅ Jobs and companies now display properly
- ✅ Filter state is consistent

### 🟡 ENHANCEMENTS

1. **Better User Feedback** (`lib/screens/job/find_job_page.dart`)
   - Added `CircularProgressIndicator` during data loading
   - Added error message with retry button on network failure
   - Improved UI/UX during async operations

2. **Companies Tab UX** (`lib/screens/network/network_screen.dart`)
   - Changed to `Consumer2` to properly watch both providers
   - Added loading state for companies
   - Added error handling with retry

3. **Debug Logging** (`lib/provider/job_provider.dart`)
   - Added console logs to track jobs/companies loading
   - Added filter tracking logs
   - Better error categorization

- `lib/provider/job_provider.dart` (fetchJobs + _applyFilters methods)
